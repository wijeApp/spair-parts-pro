echo 🗑️ DELETE BUTTON & API - TESTING
echo.

echo ✅ Implementation Complete:
echo    [✓] Delete buttons in UI cards (admin only)
echo    [✓] JavaScript delete function
echo    [✓] DELETE API endpoint (/api/spareparts/{id})
echo    [✓] Admin role validation
echo    [✓] MySQL database integration
echo.

echo 🧪 Test Steps:
echo    1. Application should be running on http://localhost:8082
echo    2. Login as admin (admin/admin123)
echo    3. Look for red Delete buttons on item cards
echo    4. Click delete button to test API call
echo    5. Confirm deletion and verify item is removed
echo.

echo 🔒 Security Test:
echo    1. Logout and login as user (user/user123)
echo    2. Verify NO delete buttons are visible
echo    3. Clean interface without admin features
echo.

echo Opening application...
start http://localhost:8082/login

echo.
echo 📋 Expected Results:
echo    ✅ Admin: Red delete buttons visible and functional
echo    ❌ User:  No delete buttons, read-only interface
echo.

# Admin Delete Functionality Verification

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to verify the delete functionality for admin users in the spare parts management dashboard.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17+ installed
- MySQL server running
- Port 8082 available (or configured port in application.properties)

## Steps to Verify Admin Delete Functionality

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd e:\my-pro\spair-parts-pro\spairparts-UI-01\spairparts
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Login as Admin
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8082/login`
- Use the admin credentials:
  - Username: `Admin`
  - Password: `Admin123`

### 3. Verify Delete Button Visibility
- After login, you should be redirected to the dashboard
- Each item card should show a "üóëÔ∏è Delete" button in the top-right corner
- In the console (F12 Developer Tools), you should see log messages like:
  ```
  üîí Admin Status Debug:
  - isAdmin (from server): true (type: boolean)
  - isAdminForced: true
  - currentUser: Admin
  - userRole: ADMIN
  ```
- For each item, you should see:
  ```
  Item X: isAdmin=true, isAdminForced=true, deleteButton=VISIBLE
  ```

### 4. Test Delete Functionality
- Click on the "üóëÔ∏è Delete" button for any item
- A confirmation dialog should appear: "üóëÔ∏è Are you sure you want to delete 'Item Name'? This action cannot be undone."
- Click "OK" to confirm deletion
- You should see a success message: "‚úÖ 'Item Name' has been deleted successfully!"
- The item should disappear from the dashboard

### 5. Verify Backend Security
- In the console logs, you should see:
  ```
  Calling DELETE API: /api/spareparts/X
  API Response: 200 OK
  ‚úÖ Delete successful: Item deleted successfully
  ```
- Examine server logs to confirm proper role validation

### 6. Verify Regular User Restrictions
- Logout from the admin account
- Login as a regular user:
  - Username: `user`
  - Password: `user123`
- Verify that delete buttons are not visible on the item cards
- In the console, you should see:
  ```
  üîí Admin Status Debug:
  - isAdmin (from server): false (type: boolean)
  - isAdminForced: true  (Note: this should be removed in production)
  - currentUser: user
  - userRole: USER
  ```

### 7. Attempt Direct API Access
For security testing, try to bypass the UI by directly calling the delete API as a regular user:
```javascript
// Run this in the browser console when logged in as a regular user
fetch('/api/spareparts/1', {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(`Status: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
    return response.text();
}).then(text => {
    console.log(`Response: ${text}`);
});
```
You should receive a 403 Forbidden response with the message "Admin access required to delete items".

## Current Implementation

### Frontend (JavaScript in spareparts-sample.html)
```javascript
// Store admin status from server
const isAdmin = [[${isAdmin}]] || false;
const currentUser = '[[${username}]]' || 'User';
const userRole = '[[${userRole}]]' || 'USER';

// TEMPORARY DEBUG: Force admin status for testing
// Remove this line once testing is complete
const isAdminForced = true;

// Create delete button HTML - FORCED VISIBLE FOR TESTING
const deleteButtonHtml = (isAdmin || isAdminForced) ? `
    <button onclick="deleteItem(${item.id}, '${item.name}')" 
            class="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-500 to-red-600 hover:from-red-600 hover:to-red-700 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-lg text-xs font-semibold transition-all duration-300 transform hover:scale-105 ml-2">
        üóëÔ∏è Delete
    </button>
` : '';

// Delete item functionality (admin only)
async function deleteItem(itemId, itemName) {
    // TEMPORARY: Allow deletion for testing with forced admin
    if (!isAdmin && !isAdminForced) {
        alert('‚ùå Access denied. Only administrators can delete items.');
        return;
    }

    // Confirmation and deletion logic...
}
```

### Backend (SparePartsController.java)
```java
@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<?> delete(@PathVariable Long id, Authentication authentication) {
    // Check if user is authenticated
    if (authentication == null) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(401).body("Authentication required");
    }
    
    // Get user and check if admin
    String username = authentication.getName();
    User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username).orElse(null);
    
    if (user == null || !"ADMIN".equals(user.getRole())) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(403).body("Admin access required to delete items");
    }
    
    // Perform deletion
    boolean deleted = service.delete(id);
    
    if (deleted) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body("Item deleted successfully");
    } else {
        return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
    }
}
```

## Recommendations for Production
1. Remove the `isAdminForced` flag from the JavaScript code
2. Consider adding additional security measures like CSRF tokens for DELETE operations
3. Add server-side logging for all delete operations for audit purposes
4. Consider adding a "soft delete" option that marks items as deleted without permanently removing them
5. Add confirmation before deletion to prevent accidental deletions

## Troubleshooting
- If delete buttons don't appear for admin users, check browser console for JavaScript errors
- If delete operation fails, check server logs for authorization or database errors
- If the application doesn't start, ensure MySQL is running and port 8082 is available

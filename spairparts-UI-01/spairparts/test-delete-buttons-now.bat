echo ðŸ”’ ADMIN DELETE BUTTONS - Testing Implementation
echo.

echo The delete buttons are already implemented in the dashboard!
echo.

echo Current Implementation:
echo âœ… Delete buttons only show for admin users
echo âœ… Backend validates admin role before deletion
echo âœ… Frontend prevents non-admin access
echo.

echo Test Accounts:
echo ðŸ‘¤ Admin: admin / admin123 (WILL see delete buttons)
echo ðŸ‘¤ User:  user / user123   (will NOT see delete buttons)
echo.

echo Starting application with H2 database (no MySQL required)...

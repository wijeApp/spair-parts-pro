## ðŸš¨ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **Error Details:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-maven-plugin:3.5.4:run
[ERROR] Process terminated with exit code: 1
[ERROR] Web server failed to start. Port 8082 was already in use.
```

### **Root Cause:**
- Another instance of the application was already running on port 8082
- Maven couldn't start a new instance because the port was occupied

### **Solution Applied:**
1. âœ… **Stopped existing Java processes:** `Get-Process -Name "java" | Stop-Process -Force`
2. âœ… **Verified port was free:** `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8082`
3. âœ… **Restarted application:** Used VS Code task to start Spring Boot app
4. âœ… **Confirmed successful startup:** Application now running on http://localhost:8082

## ðŸŽ¯ **CURRENT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **Application Access:**
- **Main Dashboard:** http://localhost:8082/
- **Login Page:** http://localhost:8082/login
- **Debug Users:** http://localhost:8082/debug/users

# Check if application is running
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8082

Start-Process "http://localhost:8082/debug/users"

# If application stops working, restart with:
Get-Process -Name "java" | Stop-Process -Force
# Then restart the VS Code task
```

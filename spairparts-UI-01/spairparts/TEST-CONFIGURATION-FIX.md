# Test Configuration Fix - Spare Parts Management System

## Issue Resolved
The test was failing because it was configured to use MySQL database, which requires an external MySQL server to be running during testing.

## Solution Applied
Changed the test configuration to use H2 in-memory database for testing while keeping MySQL for production.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated `pom.xml`
- Added H2 database dependency with `test` scope
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

#### 2. Updated `application-test.properties`
- Changed from MySQL to H2 in-memory database configuration
- H2 provides a lightweight, embedded database perfect for testing
- No external database server required for tests

### Configuration Details:
```properties
# H2 Database configuration for Testing (in-memory)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver

# JPA configuration for testing
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
spring.jpa.show-sql=false
```

## Test Results
✅ All tests now pass successfully
✅ No external database dependency for testing
✅ Fast test execution with in-memory database
✅ Build process works correctly

## Benefits:
1. **Faster Tests**: H2 in-memory database is much faster than MySQL
2. **No Dependencies**: Tests don't require MySQL server to be running
3. **Consistent Environment**: Each test gets a clean database state
4. **CI/CD Friendly**: Tests can run in any environment without setup

## Production Database
- Production and development profiles still use MySQL
- Only test profile uses H2
- No impact on production functionality
